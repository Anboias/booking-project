### Booking app

I would have liked to:

- have better UX around validation errors, especially around the date field
- use more dictionaries instead of arrays, for O(1) access time
- perhaps use query params to store data between pages instead of draft passengers list in store
- not have any useEffects
- have an initial passenger form available without having to click on an add passenger button
- store data in local storage so that it persists in case of accidental page refresh
- not have issues with installing Orbit components, so that accesibility and styling is on point. Unfortunately, I was not able to found a solution in timely manner
